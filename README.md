**Project Summary:**

This project is intended to be a great resource for movie aficionados as well as a helpful resource for anyone looking for a decent movie to watch. To get a list of movies, the project uses the IMDB API. The app is  composed of three screens: 2020 movies, popular movies, and Favorites. When the app first launches, it prompts the user to create an account. The 2020 movies page uses the IMDB API to pull a list of 2020 movies. The image URL retrieved from the API is used to display each movie as a poster. You can add a movie as a favourite by tapping on the ðŸ–¤Â icon, and then go to the Favorites tab to see a list of your favourites.

**Project Objective:**

* Assist users to find interesting movies easier.
* Help users to know popular movies easily. 
* Assit users to save their favorite movies.
